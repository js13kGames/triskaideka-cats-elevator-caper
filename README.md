Triskaideka-Cat is the star of this purr-fectly cuddly elevator caper.  The story begins when our weary traveling hero seeks shelter for the evening at a Totally Normal Hotel:tm:. It turns out this hotel is anything BUT normal, and our hero finds themselves trapped by the nefarious treiska√≠deka-ites.

Now, you must challenge the denizens of each floor and find a way to escape before your nine lives are up.  Jump, collect, flap, and fight the rascally rats that fill the hotel floors--throwing balls of yarn, bopping, and even gambling your way out of treachery.  Reach the 13th floor and a fat cat boss is waiting to annoy you.

Use W, A, S, D or ARROW keys to jump and move, and CLICK or use SPACEBAR to shoot yarn at enemies

Competition Notes -- Unless we can re-submit, our Game had a one-off bug when we submitted in a rush on Friday, 13 right before 7:00 AM EST.  We submitted early IN ERRORdeadline was actually 1:00 PM CST (and this note was writted and committed before that time).  We have patched the code and re-zipped here #inCaseItMatters
